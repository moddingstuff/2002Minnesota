After a few forays into statewide elections, he stood against incumbent Senator Rudy Boschwitz in 1990—and shocked the nation by becoming the only candidate to unseat an incumbent in that year's Senate elections. From his denunciation of Jesse Helms to his passionate opposition to the Gulf War, his tenure has undoubtedly been one of controversy.
