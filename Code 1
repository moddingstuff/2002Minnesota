You talk too much.”</i><br><br>A longtime grassroots activist, Paul Wellstone got his start in politics by standing up for the rural poor. After a few forays into statewide elections, he stood against incumbent Senator Rudy Boschwitz in 1990—and shocked the nation by becoming the only candidate to unseat an incumbent in that year’s Senate elections. From his denunciation of Jesse Helms to his passionate opposition to the Gulf War, his tenure has undoubtedly been one of controversy. Nevertheless, he has familiarized himself with the ways of the Hill, and passed progressive legislation on child-labor, the minimum wage, and mental health, in spite of his disdain for Clinton-esque neoliberalism.<br><br>Wellstone is disgusted by fundraising, marketing, and polling. Between that, his left-liberalism, his past arrests, and his anti-war grandstanding, he is certainly a vulnerable incumbent, especially in the post-9/11 environment. His opponents have hitherto failed to exploit his many weaknesses — time will tell whether this year will be different.","color_hex":"#0055aa","secondary_color_hex":null,"is_active":1,"image_url":"https://i.imgur.com/nEfd2gh.jpg","electoral_victory_message":"<h3>REAL PATRIOT DUMMY EXAMPLE SWEEPS</h3>","electoral_loss_message":"<h3>Fake News?</h3>","no_electoral_majority_message":"<h3>DUMMY EXAMPLE RETURNS TO HELL</h3>","description_as_running_mate":null,"candidate_score":1,"running_mate":false,"scrollable":false}},{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":201,"fields":{"first_name":"Norm","last_name":"Coleman","election":20,"party":"Republican","state":"Ramsey County","priority":1,"description":"<b>Under Construction?</b><br><br><i>\"I have never sought any other political office.
