You talk too much.”</i></p><p>Born and raised in the D.C. area, a young Paul Wellstone went to college in North Carolina, and became an undefeated Atlantic Coast Conference wrestling champion. He married Sheila Ison in 1963. Graduating in 1969 with a degree in political science, he settled down in Northfield, Minnesota, accepting a position as political science professor at Carleton College.</p><p>During his tenure as a professor, Wellstone was very active in the progressive and anti-war movement — in fact, he was arrested for protesting the War in ‘70. In the ‘70s and ‘80s, Wellstone began community organizing, and participating in the labor movement. In fact, he was briefly fired from the college for his activism — before the students staged a sit-in, demanding that Carleton rehire him.<br><button onclick='next2()'>Next</button><br></p></span><span id='screen2' style='display: none;'><p>In ‘82, following an impassioned speech at the state DFL convention, he was nominated by the party for State Auditor, but was bombed out by popular incumbent Arne Carlson. In ‘88, he chaired the Dukakis/Bentsen campaign in Minnesota. In ‘90, he challenged two-term incumbent Rudy Boschwitz for Minnesota’s Senate seat. As a serious underdog, Wellstone ran an underdog, grassroots campaign, and shocked the nation by being the only candidate to upset a Senate incumbent in 1990. Boschwitz came back for revenge in ‘96. Despite his unpopularity and lack of funding, Wellstone, perhaps aided by the Clinton/Gore sweep in Minnesota, beat Rudy in a close rematch.</p><p>In the Senate, Wellstone has been proclaimed the most controversial delegate in the chamber, first for denouncing Jesse Helms’ brand of politics, and next for firmly opposing the Gulf War. Liberals across the nation deemed him the “conscience of the Senate”, whilst conservatives used him as a scapegoat to fuel their appetite for fury. With Norm Coleman polling dangerously close to him, and with Wellstone stuck in a lose-lose situation with the War on Terror, Wellstone will have to crank it up to eleven if he doesn’t want to crash and burn this fall.<br><button onclick='back1()'>Back</button></p></span>","color_hex":"#324bff","secondary_color_hex":null,"is_active":1,"image_url":"https://github.com/moddingstuff/2002Minnesota/blob/main/Wellstone.png?raw=true","electoral_victory_message":"<h3>REAL PATRIOT DUMMY EXAMPLE SWEEPS</h3>","electoral_loss_message":"<h3>Fake News?</h3>","no_electoral_majority_message":"<h3>DUMMY EXAMPLE RETURNS TO HELL</h3>","description_as_running_mate":null,"candidate_score":1,"running_mate":false,"scrollable":false}},{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":1002,"fields":{"first_name":"Norm","last_name":"Coleman","election":20,"party":"Republican","state":"Ramsey County","priority":1,"description":"<p><i>\"I have never sought any other political office. I have no other ambition other than to be mayor.\"</i></p><p>Growing up in Brooklyn and attending Hofstra University in the 1960s, Norm Coleman spent much of his college years protesting the Vietnam War and the Nixon administration. After receiving his law degree from the University of Iowa in 1976, he took a job in the office of Minnesota Attorney General Warren Spannaus. Rising through the ranks quickly, he eventually became Solicitor General. It was during this period when he met an actress named Laurie Casserly, who he married in 1981.</p><p>In 1993, Coleman announced he would run for mayor of St. Paul, and was elected as a Democrat. By then, his views had evolved from those of a liberal Democrat to those of a fiscal conservative. As mayor, he notably brought professional ice hockey back to Minnesota. However, he was frequently at odds with the DFL leadership, as well as the more progressive activist DFL base. He was rarely invited to DFL events, and he would be booed at those he did attend. Still, though, St. Paul managed significant economic growth throughout Coleman’s tenure, and gained 18,000 jobs, a fact Coleman frequently cited on the trail.</p><p>Coleman insisted that he remained a proud Democrat, even if some of his values had changed, and that his commitment to the party had not wavered. In ‘96, Coleman endorsed both President Bill Clinton and Senator Paul Wellstone for their respective re-election races, and even chaired Wellstone’s campaign.</p><p>In ‘97, however, he had had enough with the DFL — he became a Republican, stressing that this floor-crossing did not impact his view on the issues. That year, he was re-elected mayor of St. Paul as a Republican. In 1998, he was drafted by the state Republican party to run for Governor. Early polls indicated a tight race between him and Attorney General Skip Humphrey, son of Hubert — however, WWF wrestler and commentator Jesse Ventura, Minnesota Independence Party candidate, shocked the nation by beating both Humphrey and Coleman in an upset.</p>","color_hex":"#960032","secondary_color_hex":null,"is_active":1,"image_url":"https://github.com/moddingstuff/2002Minnesota/blob/main/ColemanImage.png?raw=true","electoral_victory_message":"<h3>REAL PATRIOT DUMMY EXAMPLE SWEEPS</h3>","electoral_loss_message":"<h3>Fake News?</h3>","no_electoral_majority_message":"<h3>DUMMY EXAMPLE RETURNS TO HELL</h3>","description_as_running_mate":null,"candidate_score":1,"running_mate":false,"scrollable":false}},{"model":"campaign_trail.candidate","pk":1003,"fields":{"first_name":"Minnesota","last_name":"DFL","election":20,"party":"National Democratic Party","state":"Minnesota","priority":1,"description":"<span id='screen3' style='display: initial;'><p>The Minnesota DFL has, quite possibly, one of the most illustrious histories of any state affiliate of a major party.
