You talk too much.”</i><br><br>A longtime grassroots activist, Paul Wellstone got his start in politics by standing up for the rural poor. After a few forays into statewide elections, he stood against incumbent Senator Rudy Boschwitz in 1990 — and shocked the nation by becoming the only candidate to unseat an incumbent in that year’s Senate elections. From his denunciation of Jesse Helms to his passionate opposition to the Gulf War, his tenure has undoubtedly been one of controversy. Nevertheless, he has found a way to compromise and has had his accomplishments in the fields of mental health, the minimum wage, and campaign finance reform.<br><br>Wellstone is disgusted by fundraising, marketing, and polling. Between that, his left-liberalism, his past arrests, and his anti-war grandstanding, he is certainly a vulnerable incumbent, especially in this environment.
